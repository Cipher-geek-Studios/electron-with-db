Hello coders this is Roshan from Cipher geek Studios.

The above repository is an example to connect electron to local db and use all the db function.

You can INSERT, SELECT, DELETE data rows from the electron using javascript.
My db structure is
path: ./tmp/test.db
datasource: sql.js (sqlite3)
TABLE: data(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        state CHAR[50]);
